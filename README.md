# MSCS_634_Lab_1

The main purpose of this lab is to explore and understand this dataset from a coffee shop which shows the date, time, csh/card, card number, money and the type of coffee. I was able to perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis technique. I was able upload the data set using pandas, that I got from kaggle. I was then able to create some data visulizations, one was to see what the most popular drink at the coffee shop which was the Americano with Milk. I then created another visual to see what drinks were popular during which months. I also needed to see if there were any missing values, which I had 29 missing values from the card column which I filled with N/A. I didn't really come across any issues other than having to fill in missing values.
